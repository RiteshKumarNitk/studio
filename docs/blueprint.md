## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A light, refreshing blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke cleanliness and water. This contrasts well in a light color scheme and has a modern feel.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). It maintains the water theme while ensuring readability of content.
- Accent color: Silver-gray (#C0C0C0) is incorporated into interactive elements, to reflect cars. This provides visual contrast and sophistication without being too bold.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Poppins' gives a contemporary feel and 'PT Sans' enhances readability for longer content.
- Use custom, playful icons related to car washing, water, and cleanliness.
- Grid layout for services and pricing cards to display content in an organized manner.
- Subtle animations (Framer Motion or GSAP style) on hover effects, button interactions, and transitions between sections.
